## Distance Calculator
# Speed check in roads, Driverless car to detect obstacles, Fuel level in tanks , used in large number of application such as Radar for robotics, blind man walking stick ,etc. Wireless distance measurement using ultrasonic sensor is one other cheapest among various option.In this project distance measurement and location of an object by using ultrasonic sensor and microcontroller is present.
# This circuit is developed by interfacing ultrasonic sensor "HC-SR04" with AVR microcontroller "Atmega328" . This sensor uses a technique called "ECHO" which is something you get when sound reflects back after striking with a surface.
— Nowadays, we have some difficulties in obtaining the distance that we want to measure. Even though, measuring tape is an easy option, but this kind of tool will have a limitation of manual error. Before this, engineers have produced a range finder module but in the end, they find out the module have
many disadvantages like limitation for distance, different result
for different coloured obstacles, and need a calibration for every
time before starts using it. Manual distance measuring is always
done at the expense of human error. Precise and fix
measurement of low range distance, is the main objective for this
project. This device can measure distance in the range of 0.5m to
4m with the accuracy of1cm.This project is used to measure the
distance by using ultrasonic sensors. It works by transmitting
ultrasonic waves at 40 kHz. Then, the transducers will measure
the amount of time taken for a pulse of sound travel to a
particular surfaces and return as the reflected echo. After that,
the circuit that have been programmed with AT mega
microcontroller will calculate the distance based on the speed of
sound at 25°C which an ambient temperature and also the time
taken. The distance then will be display on a LCD module. The
importance of the project is calculating accurate distance from
any obstacle that we want to measure. The device can be used in
many different fields and categories like distance calculation in
construction field, robots, car sensor to avoid obstacles and
many other applications. The building process of the device was
based on using as much as possible from the courses taken in the
university, like Micro Processor, Basic Electrical Engineering,
Multimedia and systems and Electronics Devices and also
practical work in the laboratories.
